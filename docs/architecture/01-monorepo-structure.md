# Architecture Decision Record: Monorepo Structure

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Require unified management of:
- Frontend (React/Vite)
- Backend (Flask)
- Shared libraries
- Deployment configurations

## Decision
Adopt monorepo structure with following layout:

```
.
├── apps/
│   ├── web/          # Frontend application
│   └── server/          # Backend service
├── packages/
│   ├── core/         # Shared types/interfaces
│   └── config/       # Build configurations
├── infrastructure/   # Deployment scripts
└── docs/             # Architecture documentation
```

## Consequences
- ✅ Centralized dependency management
- ✅ Simplified cross-component development
- ➖ Increased initial setup complexity
- ➖ Requires tooling for workspace management
